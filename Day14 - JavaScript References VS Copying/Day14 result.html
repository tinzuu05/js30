    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // const team = players
    // console.log(team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Sam'
    // console.log(team);
    console.log(players);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()
    console.log(team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    team4[3] = 'hi'
    console.log(team4);
    console.log(players);

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    console.log(team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99
    // console.log(captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number:99, age:30})
    console.log(captain2);
    console.log(person);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person}
    console.log(captain3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
